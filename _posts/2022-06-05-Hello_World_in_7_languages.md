# Welcome to My Site

Hello and welcome to my site.  This site is going to fulfill some goals for me. Probably more than anything it will help me get my thoughts ideas and projects in writing. After that however my primary goal is to work on my writing. 

## Writing
 As I have been advised by several managers my writing is my biggest weakness.  So in order to write better I have determined that I need to write more.  So please don't judge me or my English Teachers.  I promise they tried there best there just wasn't much to work with in the first place.

## Home Lab

For years I have been wanting to build myself a real home lab where I can test and expirment with hardware and building a security stack on my own since most of my experince has been on the operations side of security.

## Coding / Programming

This is why I think my title is funny.  I know just enough of programming to get me into trouble but not really enough to be good at any of it.  I will document the things I learn along the way mostly as a way of taking notes.

## Incident Manegment

Professionaly this is what interests me.  I truly enjoy hopping on a chatoic bridge and trying to tame the chaos.  I will try and document lessons I learn but from my wins and probably more from my failures as I try to constantly improve on this skill.
